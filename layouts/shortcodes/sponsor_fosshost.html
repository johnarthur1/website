            Our partnership with <a href="https://fosshost.org">fosshost.org</a> provides us with hosting for our main
            <a href="https://dev.serpentos.com">Phabricator instance</a> and our <a href="https://download.serpentos.com">download server</a>.
            Additionally, they host our downloads &amp; repository on their dedicated mirror network. Through the hard
            work of fosshost, we're able to build scale into our architecture from the very start.
